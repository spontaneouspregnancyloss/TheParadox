                <h3>The Paradox of Sacred Space</h3>
                <p>The uterus embodies the ultimate contradiction - it is simultaneously the safest place on earth for new life and the place where that same life may be released. This isn't a failure of design, but rather the profound wisdom of a space that knows both when to hold and when to let go.</p>
            </div>

            <p>In many cultures, the womb is revered as sacred space - the first home, the place of creation, the source of life itself. Yet this same sacred space must sometimes make the difficult decision to release what it has so lovingly held.</p>

            <p>The womb's ability to discern when to nurture and when to release reflects an ancient biological wisdom that operates beyond our conscious control or emotional timeline. This duality doesn't diminish its sacredness; it deepens it.</p>

                <div class="practice-title">Sacred Space Meditation</div>
                <p>Place your hands on your lower abdomen. Breathe deeply and acknowledge your womb as sacred space - capable of both holding and releasing with wisdom beyond understanding. Spend 10-15 minutes in this acknowledgment, sending gratitude to this part of your body for its efforts in both nurturing and protecting.</p>

                <p>Write a compassionate letter to this part of your body, thanking it for its efforts in both nurturing and protecting, even when the outcome wasn't what you hoped for. Acknowledge its dual nature as both sanctuary and site of release, honoring both aspects as sacred.</p>

                <p>Create a visual representation showing the duality of the womb - perhaps as a sanctuary and a gentle release, honoring both aspects as sacred. Use colors, symbols, or abstract forms that represent both the holding and the letting go.</p>

                        <p>The reproductive system can restore itself remarkably quickly after pregnancy loss - often within weeks, the body signals readiness for another pregnancy. Yet emotional healing follows its own timeline, creating a profound disconnect between physical capability and psychological preparedness.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This contradiction can feel overwhelming: your body announces its readiness to try again while your heart may still be processing the previous loss. The return of fertility can bring hope and terror in equal measure - hope for what could be, terror of experiencing loss again.</p>
                    <p>There's no "right" timing where body and heart align perfectly. This asynchrony is normal and doesn't indicate you're "not ready" or "taking too long" - it simply reflects that physical and emotional healing are different processes with different timelines.</p>

                        <p>The reproductive system can restore itself remarkably quickly after pregnancy loss - often within weeks, the body signals readiness for another pregnancy.

                        <h3>When Physical Reality Lags Behind Medical Reality</h3>
                        <p>The body's appearance can remain pregnancy-like for weeks or months after loss - the belly may stay rounded, breasts remain enlarged, the glow of pregnancy may linger. This creates a painful contradiction between looking pregnant to the world while knowing internally that the pregnancy has ended.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This visual lag creates complex social interactions. Others may congratulate you or ask about your pregnancy, not knowing about the loss. Your mirror reflects a pregnant-looking person while your heart knows the truth. The body's slow return to its pre-pregnancy state becomes a daily reminder of what was and is no longer.</p>
                    <p>Understanding this as a normal part of physical recovery can help reduce self-criticism. Your body isn't being stubborn or slow - it's following its own timeline for returning to its pre-pregnancy state, independent of your emotional timeline.</p>
